Description: 
  Provides tools for circular nonparametric regression when the response variable is angular 
  and predictors include a combination of continuous and categorical covariates. Implements 
  both Nadarayaâ€“Watson and local linear estimators using product-kernel structures, with support 
  for kernel-based bandwidth selection via cross-validation, bootstrap, and rule-of-thumb methods. 
  Includes graphical tools for model assessment, residual diagnostics, and confidence bands. 
  Designed for applications in cognitive science, psychophysics, spatial perception, and any 
  context where orientation or angular outcomes depend on heterogeneous covariates.
